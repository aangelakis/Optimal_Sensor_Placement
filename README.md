This repo is about two algorithms that we developed, one that put optimally sensors on a water distributed network to cover it all and an extension of it, that puts more sensors so every edge of the graph is accessed by at least two sensors. This is useful for detecting any water leaks a water pipe might have. More information about the algorithms you can find in our notebooks, the code is also given. You can also read our paper (TBA) that explains the algorithms in depth.
